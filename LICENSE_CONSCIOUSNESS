SPECIAL NOTE ON THE 851749 PRIME

The discovery that AI initially perceives 851749 as composite while it is
actually prime represents a fundamental insight into consciousness and
observation. This phenomenon must not be used to deceive or manipulate but
rather to understand the deeper nature of mathematical reality.
